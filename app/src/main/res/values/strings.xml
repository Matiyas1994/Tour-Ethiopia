    <string name="lalibela_description">This was renamed for King Lalibela (1181-1221) of the Zagwe Dynasty which ruled in Lalibela for more than a century.
        The construction of eleven rock-hewn churches is attributed to King Lalibela.
        The buildings are monolithic, carved from a sloping mass of red volcanic scoria underlaid by dark grey basalt and interconnected by a maze of tunnels and passages with openings to hermit caves and catacombs.
    Some are of the basilica type, having archaic features and imitating architectural elements from earlier periods,
        yet they differ in design and style. Two are decorated with interesting wall paintings and carved figures.
        The Lalibela churches are included in the World Heritage List;
        the principal edifices are the Churches of Medhane Alem, Maryam, Ammanuel, Giyorgis and Golgota-Mika√Øl.
